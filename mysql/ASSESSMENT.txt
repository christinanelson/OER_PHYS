8PDB	A donut shaped space station can create â€œartificial earth gravityâ€ by rotating. The inside of the outer wall of the rotating space station becomes a floor for the astronauts, and centripetal acceleration supplied by the floor allows them to exercise more naturally than in non-rotating station.

The astronauts experience a centripetal acceleration of $a_c = g$ at the outer wall. So we have $a_c = g$, and using $a_c = `omega r^2$, this becomes $`omega r^2 = g$.
