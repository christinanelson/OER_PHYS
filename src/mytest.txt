A marble rolls horizontally on a table top at a constant speed of 2.25 m/s. The marble rolls off the edge of the table and arcs towards the floor landing in a cup that is 1.50 m from the edge of the table. (No friction or air resistance). ``a) What is the height, $h$, of the table above the ground?``b) What is the displacement $`vec{y}$ of the table top as measured from the top down to the ground

A toy dart gun uses a compressed spring to fire a dart of mass 0.100 kg horizontally. The spring in the toy has a spring constant $k = 250$ N/m and it is pushed in a distance of 6.0 cm from the relaxed position of the spring. `` a) What $speed$ does the dart leave the barrel of the toy gun? (Hint: use conservation of energy). `` b) If the toy is held horizontally above the ground at a height of 1.32 m when it is fired, how $far$ did the dart travel?

A cylinder of mass $m = 1.32$ kg and radius $r = 0.25$ m rolls down a $25^{`circ}$ incline without slipping or friction. The incline is 1.25 m long. How $fast$ will it be moving at the bottom of the incline if it starts from rest at the top? The moment of inertia of a cylinder rotating about its axis is $I = (`frac{1}{2})mr^2$. `` `begin{figure}[h] `begin{center} `includegraphics[scale=0.4]{pdb-14.png}`end{center} `end{figure}

A bullet is fired from a rifle aimed horizontally (parallel to the ground) at the bullseye of a target. The speed at which the bullet leaves the barrel is 825 m/s. The bullet strikes 0.006 m directly below the bullseye. What horizontal distance did the bullet travel from the end of the rifle barrel to the target? Ignore air resistance.
